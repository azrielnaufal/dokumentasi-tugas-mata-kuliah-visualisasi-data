Trade surplus plays an important role to keep Indonesia’s capital market remain attractive in 2021. Like a vaccine, trade surplus keeps our financial system healthy amid high volatility from the global financial market due to The Fed’s tapering and a spike in energy prices. Indonesia’s trade surplus significantly reduces Rupiah volatility and stabilizes Indonesia's gov’t bond yield. As the consequence of stable Rupiah and Indonesia’s 10-year gov’t bond yield, JCI performed strongly in 2021, rallied by 7.5% (ytd) as of 26th November 2021.

However, the recent spike in energy prices raises concern on how far Indonesia can run a trade surplus as we are still a net importer of oil and gas. To address this question, we collect historical data for the last decade to understand the interplay between commodity prices on Indonesia’s trade balance. To project precisely the performance of Indonesia’s trade balance in 2022, this report carried out the statistical simulation projection on the effect of the recent energy price spike on Indonesia’s trade. 

We reveal that the trade balance is quite resilient under higher oil prices even in our worse scenario of USD170/barrel. As long as Coal and CPO prices could stay at USD80/tonnes and MYR2,800/tonnes, Indonesia may still post trade surplus of USD2.3 bn each month in 2022F. Based on our baseline projection, the trade balance will still run at a substantial surplus of USD3.9 bn each month next year. Therefore, we can expect that Rupiah and gov’t bond yield volatility will remain low next year, a necessary condition for the stock market to perform well next year.
